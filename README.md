# UE4_Strife

Yeah this is just me remaking or porting or just doing the maps from the game Strife in UE4

I'm not trying to make money off of this or make a big deal out of it. I'm just wanting to actually follow thru with a project for once and i think that me logging and commiting my work is a good step tward that. Plus its finally something i can be like, "oh yeah, this is resume material".
