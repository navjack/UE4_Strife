# UE4_Strife

Yeah this is just me remaking or porting or just doing the maps from the game Strife in UE4

My main goal is just to have all of the map geometry and textures and lighting done. I'll attempt to bring the sprite work in by converting them to 3D geometry with MagicaVoxel.

## Current status:

* Early development

## To-Do:

* Still getting the workflow down for things
* Redo each map by taking each section of each map that is associated with a single texture and further splitting them into smaller 3D geometry objects and fixing the UVs

## More info

Check the texture authoring folder for more information on how I'm going about that.
